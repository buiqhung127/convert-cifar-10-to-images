Download the data here : https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html  
Extract the zip file and move it to the folder.  
Create the cifar-10 folder.

Look at these 2 images for more better intuition.  
Cifar-100 is similar, modify the classes list and the number of classes. 
## Illustration   
Your folder look like this before running the script.
![Alt text](before.png?raw=true "Folder tree before running the script") 
Your folder look like this after running the script.
